alexandria is a simple, lightweight php based open source e-book sharing application!
With the source code itself, there is alot to be desired in terms of features, but as its open source this gives it
the opportunity for other programmers to expand it for their use.

now that the description is out of the way, here is a run through of what each of the pages do. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. pdo_include.php 
-alexandria uses pdo_include since this allows users to use multiple databases, the one I currently work with is mysql
create a database, connect the username to it, add the username, password, and database name to the pdo_include and the rest of it works
(mysql file coming soon)

2.header.php
this file is included on each page, it includes the top links as well as the pdo_include so you only 
have to include one php file with every page.

3.booksearch.php
form page that allows search for the book

4.authornamesearch.php / booknamesearch.php / categorysearch.php / isbnsearch.php / filenamesearch.php / yearpublishedsearch.php
these files go with the booksearch.php and send back the results of a search done for each of those by its file name 
my plan in the future is to make them one file, and one file only, at the moment however... I simply haven't got to it yet

5.pdfuploader.php
uploads the php file, creates a directory for the book based on unix timestamp and includes the header.php and the booklogic.php page

6.pdfupload.php
form that sends to pdfuploader.php

7.index.php
home page that includes the header and a brief mission statement for the project if so desired

8. README
see README

9.booklogic.php
the booklogic.php is called upon every time the link for a book is opened. upon being opened it uses a database call to pull up all 
relevent information about the book
