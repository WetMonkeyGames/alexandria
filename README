alexandria is a simple, lightweight php based open source e-book sharing application!
With the source code itself, there is alot to be desired in terms of features, but as its open source this gives it
the opportunity for other programmers to expand it for their use.

the directories contain the following

1. alexandria source code 0.1
the initial barebones plain as white rice source code for the pdf upload, 
left without styling to allow programmers to build their own ajax design etc

2.alexandria with ajax
put simply this is alexandria with ajax, has yet to be updated. will comment when updated
