		<h1>The Library of alexandria</h1><br/>
		<p>The Library of alexandria was the first repository of knowledge, its existence signified a unified goal in egypt to store the 
		entirety of the worlds knowledge, unfortunately many years later, this same library burned down; and with it; a huge sum of human knowledge
		an event so regressive that some view the burning of the library of alexandria as the beginning of the dark age.</p>
		<p>Our goal on this site is simple, allow a simple forum for individuals to freely share and read the entirety of human knowledge in one
		repository, the software that the site uses is completely open source and available here</p>
